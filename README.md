Description:

EqualsTo.io is a service that helps connect people with STEM backgrounds in the boulder area with like-minded people. Rather than basing connections on judging other users’ profiles or very broad, nonspecific questions, our service connects people based on details that are much more relevant to STEM nerds.
	Say you’re a math major, so you’re always on the engineering side of campus but none of the people you run into share your appreciation for pure, unapplied mathematics. Traditional platonic meeting sites don’t take into account nitty gritty details of who you are as a nerd, but our specifically tailored questions will help to differentiate different “subcategories” of nerds which will result in stronger connections.
	We use a simple “would you rather” or “which do you prefer” questioning format which makes creating your nerd personality profile a breeze.

Vision Statement: Help foster innovation by connecting local like-minded STEM enthusiasts.

Motivation: It is no secret that engineers, scientists, and mathematicians have issues communicating and making friends. We wanted to make an app where engineers could make connections by being matched to other engineers who have similar personalities and STEM interests. Our goal is to not only create friendships, but to foster innovation by connecting bright individuals that are more likely to work together better.

Risks (What are the risks that would prevent you from completing this project?): General lack of knowledge about website and webapp design. All of the members of the team have different schedules, which may make it harder to meet up and work together.

Risk Mitigation Plan: Start the project with a small scope to assure the basics of the app are operational before adding additional features. Pair program so we can share knowledge regarding languages/software that some of us lack. Consult open repositories of similar programs to help us understand how everything comes together. Adhere to our designated development methodology and give detailed, regular updates via slack and trello so we don’t need to all be working at the same time.

Software Development Methodology: We will use Agile, but more specifically, Scrum. Scrum will have us create a product backlog with features and other work that is in an order so we know what to get done first. Then we will set up sprint cycles to make sure we actually get work done rather than get stuck in the planning phase. We cannot have a daily scrum, but to emulate the scrum methodology, we will have one scheduled group meeting per week (in person or remote) in addition to providing answers to the 3 “daily scrum” questions to a designated channel on slack when we work on the project. The three questions are “what did I accomplish most recently?”, “what am I going to work on now?”, and “Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint goal?”

Collaboration Tool: Slack, Trello
